The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of my favorite bands. My car, a 2005 Saturn Ion, only plays music with CDs (not AUX) and my first ever CD was "Greatest Hits - Red Hot Chili Peppers!

I created both unigram and bigram Markov chains using their entire discography.
In English, the unigram chain randomly chooses a starting word from any song and then checks the entire discography to see possible words that have come after it.

For example, we could randomly start with "How" - and then the unigram model would randomly choose between words such as ["long", "could"], etc.

The bigram chain works very similarily, except it generates text based on pairs of words. This results in a more coherent sentence structure, but the lyrics are much less unique and fun!

Always a tradeoff.
