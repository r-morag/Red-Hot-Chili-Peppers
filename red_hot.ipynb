    "Both models generated pretty funny lyrics that were reasonable. The bigram model specifically generated lyrics that made more sense. The sentence structure made sense, more so than the unigram. In the bigram model, my favorite line is \"Oh ah kissed ya then I missed ya\" - it totally sounds like it is straight out of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. And that is the weakness of the bigram model. Once it goes down a path of a song that uses a word that isn't heavily used by any other song (such as magik) it becomes too reliant on that one song. The unigram doesn't get locked into phrases like the bigram model does with \"She's magik sex magik sex magik\". However, the unigram model fails to make sense a lot of the time. Some quotes include \"He's a California\" and \"It's not my me\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the bigram model makes much more sense in terms of sentence structure because it takes the tuple of words before finding the third. It's weakness is that it gets locked into patterns and phrases present in specific Red Hot Chili Peppers songs. The unigram model writes very unique songs but they don't always make a whole lot of sense."
